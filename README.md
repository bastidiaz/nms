**nms** (Nomic Management System) is a web interface for managing a game of [Nomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic).

It is intended for use by the game master or a designated person to properly store all the information that stems from a game of Nomic. Other users only have view access. Rules, notes, interpretations, number and list of voters, and the like are the kinds of information expected to be seen on the interface.

There are separate interfaces per game, with each having their own file systems. This allows a game master to manage several games at once as well as continuity in cases wherein it is necessary to pause the game for a while.
